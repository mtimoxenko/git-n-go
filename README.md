# GitNGo Bash Script

## Motivation

Developed with new coders in mind, `gitngo` simplifies the Git process. Watching friends struggle with the intricacies of Git during coding challenges, especially under time constraints, sparked the creation of this tool. It's crafted to save time and reduce frustration for those who find Git's complexity a barrier to sharing their work. With `gitngo`, there's no need to memorize steps or worry over commit messages â€” just code, run, and go.

## Why Use `gitngo`?

`gitngo` is the swiss army knife for your Git operations; it's compact, efficient, and eliminates the need for multiple commands. With `gitngo`, you can add, commit, and push all in one go. It's like having superpowers for your repository management tasks!

## Quick Start

Get up and running with `gitngo` in seconds:

```bash
# Install gitngo
sudo cp gitngo /usr/local/bin/gitngo
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gitngo

# Execute gitngo to add, commit, and push your changes
gitngo
```

For more usage options or detailed instructions, see the full usage guide or use `gitngo --help`.

## New Feature: AI-Powered Commit Messages

`gitngo` now leverages AI to generate commit messages when you don't specify one. If you run `gitngo` without a commit message, it'll call upon OpenAI's GPT model to craft a unique, contextually relevant message for your commit, blending efficiency with creativity.

## Usage

Run `gitngo` from the command line in your Git repository to add all changes, commit them with an AI-generated message (if none provided), and push to the `main` branch of the remote repository named `origin`.

1. **Without Arguments:**
   - Executes `gitngo`, adding all changes and committing them with an AI-generated message, then pushing to the main branch.

2. **Specify File or Directory:**
   - `gitngo [file_path]` commits changes at the specified path with an AI-generated or specified message.

3. **Specify File and Commit Message:**
   - `gitngo [file_path] [commit message]` for precise control over what gets committed and the message used.

4. **Help:**
   - `gitngo --help` for usage information.

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- Git installed and configured
- Script must be run in a Git repository
- OpenAI API key set as an environment variable for AI-powered commit messages

## Installation

To make `gitngo` accessible from any terminal location:

```bash
sudo cp gitngo /usr/local/bin/gitngo
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gitngo
```

**Note:** Update `gitngo` with the latest version for new features and improvements.

Always use `git status` to review changes before committing to avoid unintended commits.
